`React Router` is a react library that allows us to simulate moving between pages, but in reality it changes the components that we're displaying based on what's in our URL bar. So, we are basically tricking the user into believing that he is moving from one page to another while the only thing that's changing is actually the components being rendered.

`React Router` provides us with components that we can use to "navigate" the user to different parts of our project.

The main components we're gonna be using are:
`<Switch>`
`<Route>`
`<BrowserRouter>`
`<Link>`
`<NavLink>`
`<Redirect>`
