To start creating our project we need to do the following steps:

- Install yarn
- Create a React App

**What is `yarn`?**
Yarn is a `JavaScript` package manager and task runner:

- Install yarn using the following command
  ```shell
  $ brew install yarn
  ```
  This command will install yarn globally on your device

Now let's create our React App...

**How to create a `React App`?**

- Using the terminal go to the location on your device where you want to create the project
- then using the following command

  ```shell
   yarn create react-app track-my-shows
  ```

  this will create a folder that will contain your project files

**How to run the project?**

- To run your project and see the changes you make live in your browser use the following commands
  ```shell
  cd track-my-shows
  yarn start
  ```
  The first command will take you to the project's folder
  The second command will run your project
