Now that you are done with this project, I'm here to tell you that you are not actually done.

There are endless things that you can add, but my first recommendation is to build a backend that holds the data you're using and then get rid of the dummy data after you connect the backend to the frontend. Then you can start implementing the other IceBox features like adding a show to your "want to watch list" etc.

We wish you the best of luck! Never stop coding!
