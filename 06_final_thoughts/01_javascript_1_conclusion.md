## Congratulations!!!

Congratulations on finishing this project! Take a moment to appreciate the website you have just built with React. You did great. You're more than encouraged to continue working on this project. You can add any new features you'd like it to have, change the design, or implement the features in the IceBox. It's completely up to you.

With this project, you learned how to build a simple project in React that has a huge scope of extra features that you can add later on! You were also introduced to React Router which a very useful and powerful tool. The next section has a few suggestions for you on what's the next step and what to do after finishing this project.
