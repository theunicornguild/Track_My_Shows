### What is `Track My Shows` ?

Track my shows is a directory of tv shows that lets you view a list of shows, details of a specific show, and the details of a specific episode. While building this project you'll learn a lot about React.js, React Router, and all the fun and knowledge that you gain from building a project from scratch. We are going to use Agile methodology which is a time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end, and in order to achieve that we going to use Trello and Git to build it feature by feature and keep track of the changes along the way.

After finishing this project you'll feel more comfortable with React and you'll learn how to make use of React Router which is a very useful and powerful tool.

The technologies/tools that will be used in this project are:

- React
- React Router
- Bootstrap
