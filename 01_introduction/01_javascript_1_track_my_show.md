### What is `Track My Shows` ?

Track My Shows is a project that will help you keep track of whatever shows you are currently watching. The name says it all! Have you ever watched a couple of episodes of a series, left it for awhile, and then the moment you decided to continue watching you realized you've forgotten which episode you've reached? This project will allow you to read comments on the show/episode you plan to watch, so that you can decide if it's worth your time. While building this project you'll learn a lot about [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) and the powerful tools you can integrate with them.
