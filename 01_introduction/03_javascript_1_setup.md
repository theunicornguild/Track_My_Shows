Let's start setting up the project by following these steps:

**How to fork the project?**
Go into the starter repo [github](https://github.com/grumpy13/TrackMyShows_ReactJS). On the right hand corner there is a fork button; press that. A pop-up will show up asking you which account would you like to fork this repo to, obviously you'd want to fork it to your account so choose that. What this does is it makes a copy of this repo under your username.

**How to clone the project?**
In your terminal:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/TrackMyShows_ReactJS.git
```

After forking and cloning the project all you need to do now is to go into the project directory and run it.

**How to run the project?**

- To run your project and see the changes you make live in your browser use the following commands:
  ```shell
  $ cd track-my-shows
  $ yarn install
  $ yarn start
  ```
  The first command will take you to the project's folder
  The second command will run your project
.
