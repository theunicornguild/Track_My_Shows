In this project you'll be using both `Trello` and `git`.

#### Trello

`Trello` is a tool used to help you keep track of your work. What you need to do...what you've already done and so on.

Open the project's `Trello` board which you'll find in the `Resources` section. In the board you'll find 4 lists:
_ `IceBox`: this list has all the cards/functionalities that are nice to have but not necessary (iceboxed), or you can say they are extra features you can add later.
_ `Backlog`: this list has all the cards/functionalities that you need to build in order for your project to reach the MVP level.
_ `Doing`: this list will have all the cards/functionalities that you are currently working on.
_ `Review`: this list will have all the cards/functionalities that you've finished but still need to be reviewed by someone.
\_`Done`: this list will have all the cards/functionalities that are done.

Right now all the cards are in the `backlog` and `IceBox` lists because we haven't started working on the project YET. As we start working on this project, we'll be moving the cards to the proper list.

#### Git

We'll be using git throughout the project as a version control tool to keep track of the changes we're making to the code and create checkpoints every time we finish a functionality.

You can create a new repo on [github](https://github.com/) to start your project from scratch or [Fork and clone](https://github.com/) our repo (the same one provided in `Resources`) and use it as a starting point.
